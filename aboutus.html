                    Drawing is honestly one of my proudest talents, I have been drawing and honing my art skills since I was in kindergarten. I became starry-eyed since then, easily smiting my young art-loving heart and thought “I want to do that.”

                    When I was in 12th grade, I joined a journalism club in Maximo Estrella Senior High School (MESHS), called Tala Publication. As a young aspiring artist, I wanted to get an extremely enriching experience that would provide a unique and fulfilling trip into the realm of storytelling. My job as an editorial cartoonist was always exciting whenever I was finally given a prompt, it made me giddy like a little school girl every time. Making these cartoons allowed me to explain complex topics with satire and creativity, while also presenting a unique viewpoint on crucial subjects. The process of thinking and illustrating concepts not only polished my talents as an artist but also expanded my awareness of the power of visual storytelling.

            <p>As of now, I plan to gain publicity to be able to open up my own art commission on social media. So far it has been a struggle because of school taking most of my free time such as learning how to code and the many assignments I am given; however, that doesn't stop me from pursuing my dreams as one day I will eventually be free enough to finally start working. It won't be my only job, of course, but it is one that I wish to do for myself eventually.</p>
